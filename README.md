# Hi there, I'm Yunsung 👋

## AI Research Engineer who bridges cutting-edge research with real-world applications

I'm a machine learning engineer with strong foundations in both research and practical engineering:

- 🔬 **Research background**: 10+ publications in top-tier conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR, AAAI) with 1.4K+ citations
- 💻 **Engineering experience**: Building scalable AI systems serving 5M+ MAUs
- 🌉 **Bridge builder**: Transforming cutting-edge research into technologies that actually enhance people's lives
- 🤖 Currently working on multimodal AI and autonomous agents at [Wrtn Technologies](https://wrtn.ai/)
- 🍸 Fun fact: I'm a licensed (by Korean Government) home bartender in my free time!

### What I'm passionate about

I believe the most exciting AI innovations happen when research meets real-world applications. My work focuses on:

- 🧠 Multimodal AI systems that combine vision and language
- 🤖 Building autonomous agents with memory and personalization
- 🔄 Diffusion models and generative AI
- 🚀 Scaling research prototypes to production-ready systems
